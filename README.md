# Lets Defend Investigations

## Overview
Welcome to the **Lets Defend Investigations** repository! This project is a collection of cybersecurity investigations I have conducted on the LetsDefend platform and other resources. Each investigation showcases my practical skills in analyzing alerts, identifying threats, and responding to incidents, all while simulating real-world SOC (Security Operations Center) scenarios.

This repository serves as a portfolio of my expertise in incident response, threat detection, and malware analysis.
